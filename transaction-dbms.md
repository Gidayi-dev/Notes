# Understanding Transactions and ACID Properties in DBMS

Imagine a **transaction** as a **group of actions** that a database treats as a single unit. These actions can be things like reading, writing, updating, or deleting data. For example, transferring money between bank accounts involves multiple steps:

1. Check if the sender has enough balance.
2. Subtract the money from the sender’s account.
3. Add the money to the receiver’s account.

You want all these steps to succeed **together** or fail **together**. You don’t want a situation where money is subtracted from one account but never added to the other. This is what a **transaction** ensures: a bundle of operations treated as one whole task.

## The ACID Properties: The Four Golden Rules of Transactions

To make sure transactions behave properly, they follow four key properties known as **ACID**:

1. **Atomicity (A)**
   This means “all or nothing.” Either all the steps in the transaction happen successfully, or none happen at all. Imagine flipping a switch: it’s either fully ON or fully OFF, never half-way.

2. **Consistency (C)**
   The database must start and end in a valid state. For example, account balances should never go negative (assuming that’s a rule). If a transaction breaks the rules, it won’t be allowed to complete.

3. **Isolation (I)**
   Even if many transactions happen at the same time, each should behave as if it’s running alone, without interference. Your transaction’s partial changes shouldn’t be visible to others until it’s complete.

4. **Durability (D)**
   Once a transaction is committed (finished successfully), its changes are permanent, even if the power goes out or the system crashes.

# Transaction States: The Life Cycle of a Transaction

A transaction goes through several states:

* **Active:** The transaction is currently executing.
* **Partially Committed:** It has finished its final step but changes are not yet permanent.
* **Committed:** The transaction successfully finished and all changes are saved.
* **Failed:** Something went wrong, and the transaction must stop.
* **Aborted:** The transaction rolled back (undid all changes) due to failure or errors.

# Concurrency Problems: What Happens When Transactions Interact?

When multiple transactions happen at once, their actions can overlap and interfere, leading to errors or unexpected results. The main concurrency problems are:

### 1. Lost Update

Imagine two people both trying to update the same piece of data at the same time. If they both read the old value, update it, and write it back without knowing about the other, one update gets lost. It’s like both writing on the same document but one overwrites the other’s changes.

### 2. Dirty Read

This happens when a transaction reads data that another transaction has changed but not yet committed. If the second transaction rolls back, the first transaction has read data that was never truly saved — like trusting temporary info that disappears.

### 3. Phantom Read

A transaction reads a set of rows matching some condition, but another transaction inserts or deletes rows that affect the result before the first transaction finishes. When the first transaction reads again, the new “phantom” rows appear or disappear unexpectedly.

# Locking Mechanisms: How Databases Manage Concurrency

To prevent these problems, databases use **locking** — a way to control who can read or write data at a given time.

There are two basic types of locks:

### Shared Lock (S-lock)

Used when a transaction wants to **read** data. Multiple transactions can hold shared locks on the same data simultaneously because reading doesn’t change data.

### Exclusive Lock (X-lock)

Used when a transaction wants to **write/update** data. Only one transaction can hold an exclusive lock on a piece of data at a time, and no other transaction can even read it while it’s locked exclusively.

Think of shared locks as **multiple people quietly reading a book in a library**, and exclusive locks as **someone writing or highlighting in the book, locking it for themselves**.

# Deadlocks: When Locks Get Stuck

Sometimes, two or more transactions wait on each other’s locks indefinitely — this is called a **deadlock**. For example:

* Transaction 1 locks Row A and wants Row B.
* Transaction 2 locks Row B and wants Row A.

Neither can continue because each waits for the other to release their lock.

---

## Handling Deadlocks

### Deadlock Prevention

Prevent deadlocks by designing transactions to always request locks in the same order or by using algorithms where transactions may be rolled back before deadlocks can occur (based on timestamps).

### Deadlock Detection and Recovery

Allow deadlocks to happen but detect them by analyzing who’s waiting for what (using a “wait-for” graph). When a deadlock is detected, the system aborts one transaction to break the cycle.

# Bringing It All Together: How You See This in SQL

* You start a transaction with `START TRANSACTION;`
* Use `SELECT ... FOR UPDATE` to get an exclusive lock when you plan to write.
* The database automatically handles locks to keep data consistent.
* If two transactions cause a deadlock, MySQL detects it and rolls back one transaction.
* You can check deadlocks with `SHOW ENGINE INNODB STATUS;`.

# Summary

* **Transactions** bundle multiple steps into one reliable operation.
* **ACID properties** ensure transactions are safe, consistent, and permanent.
* **Concurrency problems** happen when transactions interfere with each other.
* **Locks** protect data by controlling read/write access.
* **Deadlocks** occur when transactions wait forever, and databases have ways to prevent or fix this.
